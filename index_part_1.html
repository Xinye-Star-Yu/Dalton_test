  <p>
    Precision oncology benefits when multiple biological layers are analyzed together. This review summarizes how <strong>multi-omics</strong> integration, paired with deep learning, improves early detection, molecular subtyping, prognosis, and therapy selection. We outline typical workflows for preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, data fusion, model development, and validation, then discuss practical steps for clinical translation.

    Tumors evolve through interacting alterations across genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic, radiologic, and single-cell layers. Studying any one layer in isolation captures only a fraction of this biology. <strong>Multi-omics</strong> addresses the gap by jointly analyzing signals from several modalities. Cross-layer patterns become visible, allowing models to separate driver biology from background variation and technical artifacts.

    Deep neural architectures provide the machinery for this integration. Autoencoders and variational autoencoders learn low-noise embeddings from high-dimensional data. Graph convolutional networks reason over biological networks such as pathways and protein interactions. Convolutional networks are effective for image-like inputs from radiology and histology. Recurrent models and Transformers capture sequence context and long-range dependencies. Together, these tools align heterogeneous inputs and produce patient-level outputs that clinicians can act on: risk scores, subtype assignments, and therapy recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>
    A disciplined process is essential. Studies that succeed typically apply rigorous quality control and batch correction, choose dimensionality reduction that preserves structure, adopt an integration strategy matched to the task, and perform validation that reflects real clinical deployment. Interpretation methods such as SHAP and LIME for tabular omics, gradient or attention maps for images, and pathway-level enrichment link learned signals to mechanisms, which supports hypothesis generation and clinical trust.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Integration improves accuracy.</strong> Joint modeling across omics commonly outperforms single-omic baselines for early detection, subtype classification, survival prediction, and therapy response.</li>
    <li><strong>Representation learning stabilizes signals.</strong> Autoencoders and variational autoencoders compress noisy measurements into modality-specific embeddings that fuse cleanly and transfer across cohorts.</li>
    <li><strong>Task-matched architectures matter.</strong> Convolutional networks and vision Transformers handle histology and radiology. Recurrent models and Transformers capture sequence or temporal effects. Graph convolutional networks encode pathway structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical readouts are feasible.</strong> Compact feature panels derived from multi-omics enable practical assays for response prediction and toxicity monitoring, which can reduce trial-and-error prescribing.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretability drives adoption.</strong> Model explanations highlight metabolites, proteins, transcripts, and pathways associated with outcomes, facilitating mechanism-centric decisions and prospective testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation must be rigorous.</strong> External validation across sites with clear calibration, sensitivity, and specificity prevents over-optimism and clarifies generalizability.</li>
