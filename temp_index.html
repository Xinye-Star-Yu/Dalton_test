Untargeted LC–MS metabolomics was used to compare three sweet potato varieties, creating a high-resolution view of metabolites that shape flavor, color, and nutrition. The analysis resolved distinct metabolic fingerprints and uncovered variety-specific changes in amino acids, organic acids, and lipids. These profiles provide a foundation for breeding decisions and for linking metabolite pathways to consumer-relevant traits.

<h2>Study Overview</h2>

After sample extraction and LC–MS acquisition, feature tables were curated and normalized for multivariate analysis. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed clear separation among the BS, CS, and ZS groups, indicating robust between-variety differences. Variable importance in projection and univariate tests were then combined to prioritize features for pathway annotation.

Volcano plots summarized effect size and significance for each pairwise contrast, enabling rapid triage of candidates for structural assignment. Across comparisons, the team reported <strong>1,122</strong> differential metabolites overall, with <strong>423</strong>, <strong>571</strong>, and <strong>616</strong> features meeting thresholds in BS vs. CS, BS vs. ZS, and CS vs. ZS, respectively. Many discriminants mapped to amino acid biosynthesis, TCA-linked organic acids, and lipid remodeling pathways.

Together, these data show that flesh color and variety track with consistent metabolite shifts that can be leveraged for nutrition-forward breeding. The results also highlight pathway nodes that may explain antioxidant capacity, texture, and processing performance.
