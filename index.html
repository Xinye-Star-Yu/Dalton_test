      <em>Figure 2.</em> Workflow for integrating <strong>multi-omics</strong> data with deep learning. Steps include data cleaning and standardization, feature selection or dimensionality reduction, integration across modalities using early fusion, mid-level representation fusion, or late fusion, model development with architectures suited to the task (for example CNN, RNN or LSTM, autoencoder or VAE, graph convolutional network, Transformer), and performance assessment with accuracy, F1, AUC, and calibration metrics, followed by internal and external validation prior to clinical use.

  <h2>Technological Advancement</h2>
  <p>
    Throughput in sequencing, mass spectrometry, and imaging continues to rise, while per-sample costs gradually fall. Larger, multi-center datasets support stronger generalization. Representation learning aligns modalities into shared spaces. Attention mechanisms weight each input by context. Uncertainty estimation quantifies confidence and flags out-of-distribution cases. Together these advances shorten the path from raw assay to clinical signal and make it practical to update models as platforms change.
  </p>

  <h2>Clinical Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    Translation requires standard operating procedures that are easy to audit. Pre-analytical control and harmonized protocols reduce technical drift. Versioned preprocessing and reproducible training offer traceability. Decision support embedded in the electronic health record presents clear recommendations with concise explanations. For example, a small panel of metabolomic and proteomic markers interpreted by a validated model can help select first-line therapy, identify patients likely to benefit from combination regimens, or prompt early review when toxicity risk is high.
  </p>

  <h2>Expanded Applications</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond the core stack of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, integration with radiomics and digital pathology adds spatial context. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics expose intratumoral heterogeneity and microenvironmental interactions. Circulating biomarkers and immune receptor repertoires enable non-invasive monitoring. Microbiome features can complement host pathways that influence drug metabolism and inflammatory tone. These additions strengthen trial enrichment, adaptive dosing, and surveillance programs across cancer types.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Multi-omics reframes oncology from single-marker heuristics to comprehensive models of tumor biology. Combined with deep learning, integrated datasets yield accurate predictions, biologically grounded explanations, and compact panels that fit into routine care. Continued progress will depend on harmonized cohorts, rigorous external validation, transparent documentation, and governance that addresses privacy, fairness, and model updating. With these elements in place, multi-omics can reduce diagnostic uncertainty, shorten time to effective therapy, and improve long-term outcomes.
