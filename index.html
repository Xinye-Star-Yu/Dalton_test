  <h1><em>Multi-omics Pathways to Solve Endometriosis-Associated Infertility</em></h1>
</header>

<section aria-labelledby="abstract">
  <p>
    Endometriosis impairs fertility through a web of endocrine imbalance, immune dysfunction, oxidative stress with ferroptosis, genetic and epigenetic regulation, and microbiome shifts. This scientific review distills how <strong>multi-omics</strong> investigations connect these mechanisms to clinical phenotypes and highlight precision strategies for diagnosis and therapy. We outline practical steps that link cohort design, assay selection, curation, and integration to actionable readouts that guide surgery, hormonal therapy, assisted reproduction, and emerging adjuncts.

  <p>
    Clinical labels capture pain and infertility but hide the molecular circuits that control implantation, oocyte quality, and pelvic function. <strong>Multi-omics</strong> reframes the problem by joint analysis of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, microbiomics, and structured phenomics. Together these layers explain how local estrogen excess coexists with progesterone resistance, how macrophages, NK cells, and T cells reshape tissue niches, and how oxidative stress and ferroptosis erode follicle health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Study design is the hinge between biology and care. Clear objectives, standardized sampling, and metadata capture enable rigorous preprocessing and batch control. Representation learning and dimensionality reduction stabilize noisy high dimensional measurements into embeddings that can be clustered and linked to pathways. Networks connect cytokines, receptors, and extracellular matrix programs to impaired decidualization, altered uterine receptivity, and oocyte compromise. Translational value comes when these patterns map to interventions that clinicians can stage and track.
  </p>
  <p>
    Translation is strengthened by minimally invasive assays and spatial context. Biofluid markers from serum or follicular fluid can index inflammatory and oxidative states. Spatial and single cell profiling show where immune cells accumulate, where stromal fibrosis restricts anatomy, and how endometrial glands fail to achieve a receptive state. These readouts allow teams to test whether a proposed mechanism was actually modified, and they support adaptive decisions during the fertility journey.

  <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings from Multi-omics Studies in Endometriosis-Related Infertility</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Endocrine rewiring is local.</strong> Aromatase upregulation and reduced 17β-HSD2 create tissue estrogen dominance despite normal systemic levels, while altered progesterone receptor signaling impairs decidualization.</li>
    <li><strong>Immunity and inflammation drive persistence.</strong> Polarized macrophages, reduced NK cytotoxicity, checkpoint changes, and Th1 or Th17 signals maintain lesions and disrupt implantation.</li>
    <li><strong>Oxidative stress and ferroptosis injure follicles.</strong> Iron overload and lipid peroxidation weaken granulosa cells and oocytes and correlate with reduced oocyte yield and competence.</li>
    <li><strong>Epigenetic and transcriptional programs mis-set receptivity.</strong> Chromatin regulators and non-coding RNAs alter LIF-STAT3, FOXA2, and progesterone pathways that prepare the endometrium.</li>
    <li><strong>Microbiome imbalance modulates hormones and immunity.</strong> Genital tract and gut dysbiosis influence estrogen metabolism and inflammatory tone and associate with fertility outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision care depends on subtype and goal.</strong> Superficial disease, ovarian endometriomas, and deep infiltrating lesions have distinct risks and respond to different combinations of surgery, hormones, and ART.</li>

  <h2>Endocrine and Receptivity Biology</h2>
  <p>
    Local estrogen dominance arises from increased aromatase activity in lesions and reduced estradiol inactivation, while progesterone resistance reflects altered receptor isoforms and downstream signaling. These changes blunt decidualization, disrupt the window of implantation, and weaken the LIF-STAT3 axis that supports embryo attachment. Practical responses include agents that reduce local estrogen synthesis, protocols that restore progesterone responsiveness, and sequencing of embryo transfer to improve synchrony when stimulation effects risk mismatch.
  </p>

  <h2>Immune Microenvironment</h2>
  <p>
    Peritoneal macrophages accumulate, shift phenotype, and release mediators that support angiogenesis and adhesion. NK cell cytotoxicity is diminished and T cells skew toward inflammatory or regulatory states that hinder clearance of ectopic cells. Cytokine and checkpoint changes mirror autoimmune features and link to embryo toxicity and implantation failure. Integrated profiles combine cell states, soluble factors, and ligand receptor maps to clarify which immune levers are most relevant for a given patient.
  </p>

  <h2>Oxidative Stress, Iron, and Ferroptosis</h2>
  <p>
    Recurrent bleeding deposits iron that drives reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Granulosa cells show depleted antioxidants and vulnerability to ferroptosis, which correlates with fewer and less competent oocytes. Multi-omics readouts guide antioxidant, iron modulation, or ferroptosis-directed strategies while protecting ovarian reserve during surgery or stimulation. These approaches can be aligned with ART timing to improve oocyte yield and embryo quality.
  </p>

  <h2>Genetic, Epigenetic, and Transcriptomic Programs</h2>
  <p>
    Chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation changes modify gene networks that govern receptivity and fibrosis. Reduced ARID1A function and altered histone modification converge on FOXA2 and LIF signaling. Non-coding RNAs in tissue and exosomes tune steroid response and inflammation. Panels that combine these signals with clinical features can stratify patients for medical therapy, surgical planning, or ART pathways.
  </p>

  <h2>Microbiome and Metabolism</h2>
  <p>
    Genital tract dysbiosis and gut imbalances influence estrogen recycling and immune activation through microbial enzymes and metabolites. Profiles that favor Lactobacillus often associate with better implantation, whereas lipopolysaccharide exposure and altered short-chain fatty acids can worsen inflammation. Pilot strategies include probiotics, antibiotics in selected contexts, and diet frameworks that support metabolic and immune balance during ART.
  </p>

  <h2>Therapeutic Frameworks by Subtype</h2>
  <p>
    Superficial peritoneal disease often responds to first line hormonal suppression with timely attempts at conception. Ovarian endometriomas carry high risk to ovarian reserve and oocyte competence, so conservative surgery, careful hemostasis, and consideration of fertility preservation are central. Deep infiltrating disease combines mechanical distortion with inflammatory niches and may benefit from expert conservative surgery followed by ART. Multi-omics helps assign priority to hormone modulation, immune or oxidative stress control, and timing of retrieval and transfer.
  </p>

  <h2>Assisted Reproduction and Trial Design</h2>
  <p>
    ART outcomes depend on oocyte number, competence, and endometrial readiness. Pre-treatment that reduces inflammation or restores hormonal balance can improve stimulation response and transfer success. Protocols that preserve reserve and allow flexible triggering are often preferred. Trials that prespecify biology-based entry criteria and collect on-treatment biopsies accelerate learning about which levers move outcomes and which biomarkers truly predict benefit.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Endometriosis-associated infertility is maintained by interacting endocrine, immune, oxidative, genetic, and microbial pathways. <strong>Multi-omics</strong> organizes these elements into testable endotypes and supports targeted, staged care that protects ovarian reserve, improves implantation, and raises the chance of live birth. Progress requires harmonized cohorts, reproducible analytics, and external validation so that panels and decision rules can be trusted across sites.
