  <h1><em>Multi-omics Views of Neutrophil Diversity in Sepsis</em></h1>
</header>

<section aria-labelledby="abstract">
  <p>
    Sepsis unfolds as a systemic imbalance where infection and host response push immune cells into atypical states. Among these first responders, neutrophils display striking diversity in origin, surface phenotype, function, and metabolism. This review translates <strong>multi-omics</strong> findings into a clear narrative that links neutrophil subsets to clinical features and points to biomarkers and therapeutic levers for risk stratification, immune support, and organ protection.

  <h2 id="transforming">Reinterpreting Sepsis Through Neutrophil-Centered Multi-omics</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional models treated neutrophils as a uniform, short-lived population. Multi-layer profiling now shows a spectrum that spans bone marrow progenitors to activated and immunoregulatory states in blood and tissues. Combined evidence from genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and even the neutrophil-associated microbiome reveals how these cells reprogram in real time and how their phenotypes map to clinical trajectories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Study designs that succeed share a few traits: standardized sampling with careful isolation that preserves low-density subsets, cross-platform quality control, and analysis plans that align markers across modalities. Dimensionality reduction and representation learning stabilize noisy measurements, while pathway and network analyses connect features such as chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules, oxidative enzymes, and metabolic checkpoints to distinct endotypes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For translation, emphasis is shifting to compact signature panels and interpretable models. Surface proteins like CD177 or CXCR2, transcriptional programs that define Neu1 to Neu4 states, protein remodeling under hypoxia, and glycolytic suppression indexed by LDHA and HIF-1α can be integrated with clinical scores to guide antimicrobial therapy, immunomodulation, and timing of interventions.

  <h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings from Multi-omics Studies of Neutrophils in Sepsis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phenotypical shifts mark activation and maturation.</strong> In sepsis, markers such as CD11b, CD64, CD177, ICAM-1, and TREM-1 rise, while CD10, CD62L, CD16, and CXCR2 fall, reflecting migration, adhesion, and degranulation programs alongside altered maturation.</li>
    <li><strong>Functions diverge across subsets.</strong> Early phases feature enhanced phagocytosis and oxidative burst with impaired chemotaxis, while later phases show dampened NETosis and elements of immune suppression, consistent with transitions from hyperinflammation to immune paralysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Single-cell transcriptomics resolves clinical subtypes.</strong> Human datasets identify late-stage enriched subsets including ALPL, CD177, and S100A8/A9 positive cells and Neu1-like states that track with shock and higher SOFA scores; PD-L1 high neutrophils suppress T cells.</li>
    <li><strong>Proteomes adapt to stress.</strong> CD62Ldim subsets and hypoxia-exposed neutrophils remodel proteins involved in adhesion, receptor signaling, lysosomal scavenging, and granule biogenesis, highlighting context-responsive effector programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Metabolic rewiring underpins dysfunction.</strong> Sepsis-tolerant neutrophils show glycolytic suppression with reduced LDHA and HIF-1α activity, linking bioenergetic constraints to poor chemotaxis and phagocytosis and altered NET formation.</li>
    <li><strong>Developmental and peripheral cues both contribute.</strong> Multi-omics of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors reveals ProNeu1 and ProNeu2 branches, while peripheral inflammatory signals remodel mature neutrophils and expand immunosuppressive states.</li>

Under baseline conditions, immature neutrophils express CXCR4 and CD49d, while mature cells display CD10, CD16b, and CD35. During sepsis, inflammatory cues reprogram surface architecture with higher CD11b, CD64, CD177, ICAM-1, and TREM-1, and lower CD10, CD62L, CD16, and CXCR2, capturing activation, adhesion, and altered trafficking.

  <h2>Phenotypes and Maturation States</h2>
  <p>
    Neutrophil identity spans promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band cells, and segmented forms. In sepsis, surface repertoires shift as CXCR2 declines and CD10dim CD16dim populations expand, while CD64, CD11b, CD11c, and CD177 rise. Atypical ICAM-1 positive cells and dendritic-like hybrids appear in models of inflammation, illustrating plasticity that blurs the line between lineage and state.
  </p>

  <h2>Functions and Immune Trajectory</h2>
  <p>
    Functional heterogeneity mirrors the clinical arc. Bone marrow output increases and apoptosis delays, migration and chemotaxis weaken, oxidative burst and phagocytosis increase early then decline, and NETosis drops in patient cohorts. Some subsets acquire immunosuppressive properties and restrain T cells via PD-L1, consistent with later immune paralysis and vulnerability to secondary infection.
  </p>

  <h2>Genomics and Epigenomics</h2>
  <p>
    Neutrophil eQTL catalogs anchor inherited modulation of inflammatory pathways. Epigenomic profiling reveals histone and accessibility changes that rewire NF-κB, apoptosis, and cytokine circuits and uncover transcriptionally active subsets even under anti-inflammatory cues. These layers explain why similar stimuli drive different programs in different patients.
  </p>

  <h2>Transcriptomics at Single-Cell Resolution</h2>
  <p>
    Bulk studies identify immune and PI3K–AKT signatures but cannot separate subsets. Single-cell RNA sequencing resolves multiple clusters along the maturation axis and disease-enriched states. In humans, Neu1 expansion correlates with shock and poor outcomes and is marked by NFKBIA, CXCL8, G0S2, and FTH1, while ALPL, CD177, S100A8/A9, and STXBP2 help flag late differentiation. These signatures help define prognostic modules and therapeutic windows.
  </p>

  <h2>Proteomics Under Inflammation and Hypoxia</h2>
  <p>
    Mass spectrometry confirms that transcript shifts translate into protein remodeling. CD62Ldim neutrophils show adhesion and activation signatures; hypoxic exposure increases inflammatory receptors and supports de novo synthesis of granule and cytoskeletal proteins. Cohort size and context remain limits, but patterns reinforce a view of metabolically adaptable effectors.
  </p>

  <h2>Metabolomics and Bioenergetics</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and oxidative phosphorylation flex to meet demands for chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species generation, and NET formation. In sepsis, suppression of LDHA and related enzymes with reduced lactate accompanies impaired chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Stabilizing HIF-1α can restore glycolysis and improve effector functions in models, positioning metabolism as a tractable lever.
  </p>

  <h2>Toward Integrated Biomarkers and Patient Stratification</h2>
  <p>
    Multi-omics panels that combine surface proteins, RNA modules, and metabolic features can augment clinical scoring. Candidates include CD177 high cells tracking with severity, PD-L1 high subsets linked to T cell suppression, and glycolysis-low signatures that predict migratory failure. Integration with endothelial injury markers such as PTX3 or Ang-2 may help connect neutrophil states to vascular risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges and Study Design</h2>
  <p>
    Patient diversity, infection source, and therapy introduce variability. Isolation can miss low-density neutrophils or introduce bias. Datasets often capture a single time point, masking immune switching over days. Alignment across RNA, protein, and metabolites requires careful normalization, and mismatched kinetics between transcript and protein complicate cell classification. Longitudinal, harmonized designs with transparent preprocessing are key to robust translation.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Sepsis reshapes neutrophils across development, activation, and metabolism. <strong>Multi-omics</strong> maps these changes into mechanistic endotypes that clarify prognosis and suggest targeted interventions. With standardized sampling, integrative analytics, and external validation, neutrophil-centered panels can help move from generic supportive care to individualized immune management.
