Perinatology faces a recurring problem: many complications become clinically obvious only after key biological changes have already occurred. This review summarizes how <strong>multi-omics</strong> profiling, paired with artificial intelligence and machine learning, can shift care toward earlier prediction and more individualized prevention in pregnancy and neonatal intensive care. By integrating molecular layers with routine clinical signals, computational models can identify risk before overt symptoms, propose interpretable biomarker panels, and support decisions about monitoring, nutrition, and timing of interventions.

<h2 id="transforming">Transforming Perinatal Care with AI-based Multiomics</h2>
<p>
Modern “omics” technologies can quantify genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and microbiomes with increasing speed and falling cost. In the perinatal setting, these measurements capture both inherited susceptibility and dynamic adaptation to pregnancy, birth, and early life. A single modality often reveals associations, but it rarely explains causality or the interacting pathways that drive heterogeneous outcomes in mothers and infants. <strong>Multi-omics</strong> integration addresses this limitation by combining complementary biological layers to build a more holistic view of disease pathophysiology.
</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence provides the analytical infrastructure to learn from these high-dimensional data. Supervised learning links omics features to outcomes such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, or neonatal complications, while unsupervised approaches can discover data-driven clusters that redefine broad clinical labels. Practical model development relies on careful validation and transparent metrics. The review highlights common evaluation approaches such as AUROC for discrimination and calibration-oriented checks that help determine whether predictions are clinically reliable rather than merely statistically impressive.
</p>
<p>
The authors frame these advances within an evolution of medical practice from intuition, to evidence, to algorithm-supported precision care. In perinatology, the opportunity is especially compelling because critical windows for growth, immune maturation, and epigenetic programming are short. A disciplined pipeline that includes standardized sampling, robust preprocessing, and fairness-aware validation can turn integrated omics and clinical data into actionable risk stratification that supports earlier, safer, and more personalized interventions.

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings from Multi-omics and AI in Perinatology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-omics enables a systems-level view.</strong> Combining molecular layers can reveal interacting pathways that single-omic studies often miss, improving mechanistic insight.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction can occur before symptoms.</strong> Integrating omics with clinical variables supports models that detect risk earlier, enabling preventive strategies in pregnancy and the NICU.</li>
<li><strong>Integration timing matters.</strong> Early, intermediate, and late integration strategies trade off simplicity, the ability to capture cross-omic interactions, and robustness to heterogeneity.</li>
<li><strong>Clinically relevant use cases are emerging.</strong> Applications span pregnancy complications, timing of labor, and neonatal disorders where current definitions are broad or unstable.</li>
<li><strong>Ethics and governance are central.</strong> Fairness, privacy, and explainability must be addressed to avoid biased deployment and to maintain clinician and family trust.</li>

<section aria-labelledby="integration">
<h2 id="integration">How Multiomics and Machine Learning Fit Together</h2>
<p>
The review defines “omics” as large-scale profiling of biological systems and argues that integration is required to connect molecular change to phenotype. The authors outline three common integration timings. Early integration concatenates features across omics layers, which is straightforward but vulnerable to the curse of dimensionality when samples are limited. Intermediate integration first reduces each omics layer into a lower-noise representation, then combines these representations for downstream learning. Late integration analyzes each omics layer independently and merges predictions, which can be robust to heterogeneity but may miss cross-omic interactions. Across strategies, dimensionality reduction and careful handling of differing data types are emphasized as practical necessities for reliable model training.

<section aria-labelledby="applications">
<h2 id="applications">Clinical Opportunities in Pregnancy and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</h2>
<p>
In pregnancy, integrated profiling can characterize normal physiologic adaptation and identify early deviations that precede complications. Examples discussed include multi-omics approaches that predict gestational age, models that classify or predict preeclampsia using longitudinal measurements, and integrative signatures associated with preterm birth across cohorts. In neonatal intensive care, the authors highlight conditions with heterogeneous biology and imperfect definitions, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, where multi-omics and AI could help redefine subtypes, improve diagnostic precision, and support targeted prevention. The review also notes that continuous bedside monitoring generates dense physiologic data streams that can complement molecular profiles for more informative risk prediction.

<h2 id="ethics">Ethical, Practical, and Data Challenges</h2>
<p>
Translation into perinatal care requires attention to fairness, privacy, and interpretability. Models trained on narrow populations may not generalize across sex, race, ethnicity, or clinical settings, leading to inequitable performance. Privacy risks increase as multi-omics profiles and identifiers are combined, so governance and de-identification practices are essential. The review also emphasizes that many high-performing models are difficult to explain, which is problematic when predictions affect families, insurance, and high-stakes neonatal decisions. Addressing these concerns alongside reproducible workflows and external validation is presented as a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment.

<section aria-labelledby="conclusion">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Multi-omics technologies and AI methods are converging to make precision medicine more feasible in perinatology. By integrating molecular layers with clinical and physiologic data, models can move care toward earlier prediction, improved disease stratification, and individualized prevention strategies during pregnancy and neonatal life. Continued progress will depend on standardized sampling, robust integration choices that respect small cohort sizes, transparent model evaluation, and ethical safeguards that ensure privacy and fairness while maintaining interpretability for clinicians and families.
